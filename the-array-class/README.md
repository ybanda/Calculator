The Array Class
=========================
For this programming assignment, you will design and implement a standard
array class for characters, i.e., char types. The goal of this programming
as- signment is to provide a refresher for programming abstract data types
(ADTs) in C++. You therefore do not have to completely design and implement
an array class in C++. Instead, the design of the array class has been completed
for you. It is your job to implement the design of the array class given its
source code shell(s).

Assignment Files
------------------
The source code shell(s) can be forked from IU Github. For information
on generating the project workspace and building the project, please
see Appendix A.

Submissions
------------------
Submit all source files (.cpp, .inl, and .h), project files (.mpc and .mwc),
and Valgrind report must be submitted via Github. The Valgrind report *must*
be placed in a file named ```valgrind-report.out```.
